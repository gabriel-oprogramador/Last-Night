# Last Night
## Little 2D game that I'm making to test my engine and to test new features.
  
# Synopsis
In this game you will spend your last night in a hotel before moving, but everything changes until you are woken up by a macabre character who wants to drag you to hell and then everything that was is no longer the same.

## What's real? What's not? How to know? How do you know??
Enter this psychosis and discover what is or is not real.  
What is where the border of Real and Unreal is very thin.
